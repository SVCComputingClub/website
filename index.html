	  <p>The SVC Compute Club is for people who share an interest in computers and want to get more out of them. Last year Compute Club took two field trips to explore available options for computer science undergraduates looking to transfer to a four-year university. The destinations included Western Washington University and University of Washington. The SVC Compute Club also hosted a few game nights for people to come together and play board games. Continuing from last year, the SVC Compute Club will continue to host occasional guest speakers from the computer industry to talk about their experiences working in the industry. Any current students of Skagit Valley College are welcome and encouraged to come join the club and check it out.</p>
